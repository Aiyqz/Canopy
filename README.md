# 🌿 Canopy

A refined, productivity-focused **Dynamic Island experience for macOS** — a native SwiftUI app that wraps your Mac's notch with media controls, time-synced lyrics, a Liquid Glass lockscreen widget, a file-drop shelf, and notification mirroring.

> Inspired by [getcanopy.pro](https://getcanopy.pro/). Built from scratch in Swift.

## Features

- **Notch media player** — a black slab that hugs the notch and expands on hover into a full player: artwork, title/artist, animated EQ bars, a **scrubbable** progress bar, and play / prev / next. Reads & controls whatever is playing system-wide via the bundled [mediaremote-adapter](https://github.com/ungive/mediaremote-adapter) (works on macOS 15.4+, where direct `MediaRemote` access is otherwise blocked), with automatic fallback to the in-process `MediaRemote` bridge and then to AppleScript control of Music / Spotify.
- **Time-synced lyrics** — fetched from [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net) (free, no API key), parsed from LRC, and tracked against playback. Shown in the notch and the widget with **Apple-Music-style color gradients** sampled from the album art. **Tap a line to seek.**
- **Liquid Glass widget** — a frosted-glass **desktop** widget (behind-window blur + album-art gradient) with **4 presets**: Lockscreen-style (iOS clock + now-playing card), Now Playing (art-forward), Lyrics (scrolling synced), and Minimal Clock.
- **Screen saver** — the same now-playing card as a macOS screen saver, the closest thing macOS allows to a lock-screen widget (third-party apps can't draw on the real lock screen). See [Screen saver](#screen-saver).
- **Notch banners** — now-playing changes and **mirrored system notifications** slide down from the notch. Mirroring tails the Notification Center database (requires Full Disk Access; degrades gracefully).
- **File-drop shelf** — drop files onto the notch to stash them, then drag them back out, reveal in Finder, or clear.
- **Menu-bar app** — no Dock icon. Toggle the widget, switch presets, enable Launch at Login, and grant access from the leaf menu.

## Requirements

- macOS 14+ (developed on macOS 26 / Apple Silicon)
- Swift 6.2 / Xcode 26

## Build & run

First, build the bundled MediaRemote adapter once (needs Xcode CLT + cmake):

```sh
./Scripts/fetch-adapter.sh    # populates Resources/ with the framework + test client
```

### Xcode / XcodeGen (primary)

The `.xcodeproj` is generated from [`project.yml`](project.yml):

```sh
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme Canopy build
```

### Swift Package Manager (dev)

```sh
./build.sh release      # compiles + assembles an ad-hoc-signed Canopy.app (with icon + adapter)
open Canopy.app
```

Or during development:

```sh
swift build
swift run Canopy
```

> If you skip `fetch-adapter.sh`, the app still builds and runs — `MediaController`
> falls back to AppleScript control of Music / Spotify (which triggers an
> Automation permission prompt the first time).

### Verification render mode

The app can render its own UI to PNG offscreen (no screen-recording permission needed):

```sh
swift run Canopy --snapshot /tmp     # writes notch + widget preset PNGs
swift run Canopy --icon /tmp/icon.png
```

## Permissions

- **Media control / now-playing** — works out of the box via the bundled adapter. If the adapter is unavailable and Canopy falls back to AppleScript, macOS shows a one-time **Automation** prompt to allow controlling Music / Spotify.
- **Notification mirroring** — needs **Full Disk Access** (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → add Canopy). The leaf menu shows live status and a shortcut to the settings pane. Now-playing banners work without it.

## Screen saver

macOS has **no third-party lock-screen widget API** — the lock screen is drawn by
a separate secure process and your app's windows are hidden while locked. The
closest supported surface is a **screen saver**, so Canopy ships one
(`CanopyScreenSaver.saver`).

It works as a producer/consumer pair, because the screen-saver sandbox can't read
media or spawn helpers:

- The **app** renders the selected widget preset to a PNG ~once a second into a
  shared **App Group** container (`LockscreenFeed` → `CanopyShared`).
- The **saver** is a pure consumer that draws the latest frame
  (`CanopyScreenSaverView`).

### Install

```sh
./Scripts/install-screensaver.sh     # builds + copies CanopyScreenSaver.saver
```

Then enable **“Show on Screen Saver”** from the Canopy menu, and pick **Canopy**
in System Settings → Screen Saver.

### Signing requirement & caveats

- The app and the saver **must be signed with the same Apple Team ID** and share
  the App Group `group.pro.getcanopy.shared` — that's the only directory a
  sandboxed saver can read. Set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` (env var for the script, or in
  the Xcode project). **Ad-hoc/unsigned builds** can't share the container, so the
  saver shows a placeholder.
- This reliably shows while the Mac is **idle / screensaving**. Once it is *fully
  locked*, the saver runs in a restricted context that may not reach your
  session's frames — that's a macOS limitation, not a Canopy bug.

## Project layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `project.yml` / `Scripts/fetch-adapter.sh` | XcodeGen spec + adapter build script |
| `Resources/mediaremote-adapter.pl` | Bundled adapter script (BSD-3); loaded by `/usr/bin/perl` |
| `Sources/Canopy/main.swift` | Entry point + `--snapshot` / `--icon` modes |
| `MediaController.swift` | Resolves & drives the media backend (adapter → MediaRemote → AppleScript) |
| `AppleScriptMedia.swift` | Music / Spotify control via `osascript` (fallback backend) |
| `MediaRemote.swift` | Private MediaRemote.framework bridge (secondary fallback) |
| `NowPlayingModel.swift` | Observable state: playback, lyrics, palette, shelf, banners |
| `LyricsService.swift` | LRCLIB fetch + LRC parsing |
| `ColorExtractor.swift` | Album-art → gradient palette |
| `NotchController.swift` / `Views/NotchView.swift` | The notch window + collapsed / banner / expanded UI |
| `WidgetController.swift` / `Views/WidgetView.swift` / `Views/WidgetContent.swift` | Liquid Glass desktop widget + presets |
| `LockscreenFeed.swift` / `CanopyShared.swift` | Renders widget frames to the shared App Group container for the saver |
| `Sources/CanopyScreenSaver/` / `Scripts/install-screensaver.sh` | The `.saver` bundle (frame consumer) + installer |
| `NotificationMirror.swift` | Notification Center DB tailing |
| `SettingsStore.swift` | Persisted settings + Launch at Login |
| `AppIcon.swift` | Programmatic app icon |

## Notes

This is an independent, educational reimplementation — not affiliated with Canopy. It reaches now-playing media through the bundled [mediaremote-adapter](https://github.com/ungive/mediaremote-adapter) (BSD-3), which is invoked via the Apple-signed `/usr/bin/perl` and never linked into the app, so it is intended for personal use, not the Mac App Store.
